# Oswee Ansible Collection

This is NOT PRODUCTION READY collection!
Some of roles are specific to my particular usecases.

Most likely You don't want to use this collection ATM.

## Usage

Include the collection in your project collections.yml file and import it.

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections.yml -f
```

`-f` flag will force collection upgrade.

### Skeleton (Role bootstrapping)

To bootstrap new roles you can use Skeleton.
Use `ansible-galaxy init --role-skeleton=.skeleton namespace/roles/role-name` from the root of this repository.
`namespace/role/` prefix will be stripped in the output files.
All template files are located in `./.skeleton/*` directory.

### Molecule init

UPDATE: You should not place Molecule inside of individual role. Molecule is moved to the collection
level.

Molecule templates are handled by Skeleton so typically you should not create molecule scenarios manually.
But if you have some custom requirements, then you can generate molecule scenario boilerplate manually:

CD into specific role `cd ./roles/role-name`

Create `default` scenario (Mandatory)

```bash
molecule init scenario default -r role-name --driver-name delegated
```

Create `vagrant` scenario

```bash
molecule init scenario vagrant -r role-name --driver-name vagrant
```

Create `podman` scenario

```bash
molecule init scenario podman -r role-name --driver-name podman
```

### Molecule testing

Use this evironment variable to get the colorfule molecule run output:

```bash
export PY_COLORS=1
```

I'm sure there is something wrong with my TTY color setup, but i'm too lazy to fix it now.

To test the role use

```bash
cd collection-name
molecule converge -s role-name
```

```bash
molecule converge -s nvim -- --tags config.plugins
```

Vagrant is the only maintained scenario if at all (too early to spend time on pollishing roles).
Later potentially I will introduce Podman scenario as well.
No plans of supporting Docker.

## Known issues

There could be issues with OPENSSL library mismatch between Vagrant ruby gems and the
system libraries. The solution was to download libssl, build it and to copy libk5crypto files into
`/opt/vagrant/embedded/lib64` directory.
Follow the Fedora instructions listed in `molecule-libvirt` repository readme.
This [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11020) is the primary source to the solution

If Vagrant is complaining about inability to create `virbr0` network, most likely it is worth to re-run
`oswee.ansible.libvirt` role.
I had no jet figured out what exactly is broken, but reapplying libvirt role, helps.
